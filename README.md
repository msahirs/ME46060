# ME46060 - Engineering Optimisation: Concepts and Applications

Helloey, here is a little directory for completing the assignments of TU Delft's [**ME46060 - Engineering Optimisation: Concepts and Applications**](https://www.studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=60837) course - offered by TU Delft's Faculty of Mechanical, Martime, and Material Science Faculty (3mE), during the 2023-2024 academic year.

## Deliverables Overview
This course is *primarily* graded on a final assignment, with possible bonuses via three online quizzes and ten **MATLAB**-oriented (very sad I know) exercises. Only the programming bits of the bonus exercises and the final assignment is what this repository shall contain.

## Exercise Progress
Here's what we've implemented and finished so far for the exercises!

| Exercise | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Study of spring analysis model. Formulation of spring optimization model. | *Done* |
| 2 | Study the behavior of model functions, and learn how to recognize monotonicity, (non-)convexity and (non-)linearity. Identify properties of optimization problems including dominance, activity, well boundedness, and convexity. | *Done* |
| 3 | Understand the basic concept of line searches in more dimensional problems. Learn how to use MATLAB line search algorithm `fminbnd` and how to set optimization options. Investigate the influence of convergence parameters. | *Done*  |
| 4 | Solution of an unconstrained problem by means of a self made steepest descent algorithm using the Matlab line search algorithm fminbnd. Visualization of the optimization process. Learn how to use MATLAB algorithm `fminunc` to solve unconstrained problems. | ***In Progress*** |

## Final Assignment

With the high and dynamic loading scenarios, elements such as landing gears and payload buses - for space applications - are designed with structural integrity as its foremost factor. However, given the cascading effect of added mass on the required propellant of a launch vehicle, the ~~topological~~ structural optimisation of these structural elements could assist in saving net weight & cost. The optimisation would still need to comply with requirements imposed by the system or its subsystems, either in the form of constraints or as part of the objective function of the problem.
